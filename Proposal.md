### Usage Scenario and Tasks
Woody and Claudia are immigrating to the USA with their children and they are looking for a city with a low crime rate in order to raise their three girls in a safe environment. Woody and Claudia want to be able to explore a dataset in order to compare the public order of different cities and identify some of the safest cities among the cities that they are interested. When Woody and Claudia log on to the "Crime rate" app, they will see an overview of all four types of criminal activities. They could then filter the data to focus on their potential choices for head-to-head comparisons, and/or rank them by a certain type of crime. Claudia is particularly concerned about raping since they are raising three girls. She then finds out that some of her favorite cities such as New York and Washington D.C. are not as safe as she thought compared to other cities and therefore taking them off from her list.

### Description of Your App and Sketch 
The app contains a landing page that shows the distribution of the crime rates. There is a bar chart showing the numbers of crime for a full year averaged over the selected years for the selected cities and a line chart showing the number of crime per 100k population over the selected years. Lines are colored coded according to the cities that are being selected. Both charts will also show the national average number for comparison. From a dropdown list, users can filter out the variables from the distribution display, by cities (e.g. only checking New York, Los Angeles, Seattle), type of crime (e.g. only show robbing), and finally by the range of time (e.g. the past decade). Users can compare the crime rate distribution of different cities by checking the charts on the panel.
