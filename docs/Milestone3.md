## Milestone3

## Reflection on the usefulness of the feedback
The feedback we received during the feedback session is very useful. Reviewers were able to navigate through most parts of the app on their own. There is one issue that we heard across reviewers (typo) which we fixed it later on. Besides the typo issue, we also concluded that there are 5 more changes that we should implemented in our app after discussion on the feedback we received. The list of improvements can be found in the next section with details. Although we appreciate the feedback a lot, we did not implement everything that were mentioned in our feedback. For example, we decided not to change the color of the outliners from red to the color of the cities since it is harder to be seen in the plot but we find the feedback very helpful overall.
During the feedback session, we found the part of receiving other team's feedback the most valuable in the feedback process. It is often very helpful to hear other people's opinion from a different prespective. The "fly-on-the-wall" part helps us to understand which part(s) of the app that users could get confused (e.g. how to remove a selected city), and we probably should put some extra instructions for that in the future. In conclusion, we believe that the feedback provided us a great guideline to make an improved app.

## Reflection on how your project has changed since Milestone 2, and why
We have taken advices from all the feedback and implemented the following improvments:
1. We removed comma in year (1,995 -> 1995) in the slider
   It makes more sense that years are displated without a comma as its separator
2. We renamed the box plots title from "analysis" to "distribution"
   The box plot is showing a distribution so it makes more sense to have a title as distribution
3. Fixing typos (e.g. assault was misspelled)
   It is good to have an app without typos
4. More reader friendly coding (e.g. breaking complicate code into multiple lines for easier reading)
   It makes making more development or future updates easier
5. Adding a second city for comparison in the landing page
   This sets a better example for users to begin with the app
6. Rotated city names so it is easier to read
   Improving the read-ability of the chart
7. Other minor format changes (font sizes, etc)
